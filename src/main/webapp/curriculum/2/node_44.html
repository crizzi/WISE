              <p>Dear Gazette,</p>
              <p>My name is Suzy and I was really surprised to read about Eric 
                and his disease. I think that Eric is very brave, and I respect 
                his decisions to maintain an adventurous lifestyle. After reading 
                the article, I told my parents about Eric and cystic fibrosis. 
                I was shocked when they told me that a blood-related uncle of 
                mine passed away when he was a child from a lung failure. Does 
                this sound like cystic fibrosis to you? If it is cystic fibrosis, 
                what are the chances that I could have the disease or carry the 
                disease?</p>

              <p>Dear Gazette,</p>
              <p>My name is Bobby. I read your article the other day. It said 
                that Eric&#8217;s mother, Linda, was having another baby. My family 
                found out recently that my mom is having a baby, and that I will 
                get a new brother. I asked my parents if there were any family 
                members that had CF, and they said that they didn&#8217;t know 
                of any. Should I still be worried? Why or why not?</p>
