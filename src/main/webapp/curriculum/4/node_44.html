<font size =+1 face="Arial"> <b>In this activity</b> you investigated the greenhouse effect and learned that molecules in the atmosphere, such as CO<sub>2</sub> below, absorb infrared radiation (IR) and re-emit it back towards Earth, causing a warmer planet.
<p>But too many of these molecules can lead to <b>global climate change</b>! What do you need to <b>remember</b> about the <b>greenhouse effect</b> and <b>global climate change</b> to tell your congressperson? In the next step, <b>write notes</b> in your journal to help you remember. <br><br>After you are finished, go to the next activity where you will learn about some common chemical reactions that put more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.</TD></TR>
