Now that you made <b>4</b> CO<sub>2</sub> molecules from <b>2</b> ethane molecules, you know that the <b>coefficients</b> of the balanced equations relate to the <b>ratios</b> of molecules that react.

What if you had a whole bunch, like <b>20,000</b> molecules of ethane and <b>70,000</b> molecules of oxygen? How many molecules of carbon dioxide and water would form? <br><br>

(Hint: use the coefficients of the balanced equation)</td>
