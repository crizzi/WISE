Scientists use models to help predict what will happen to the Earth's temperature. You will use a greenhouse model in the next step to help you learn how the greenhouse effect warms the Earth. In the model:
<ul><li>The Earth is pink, the surface is green and the atmosphere is blue.</li>
<li>Yellow arrowheads represent sunlight energy, red dots represent heat energy, and pink arrowheads represent infrared (IR) energy emitted by the Earth. (Don't know IR? Click on the "Hints" button, the question mark on the upper left corner.)</li>
<li>The model represents Earth's atmosphere now. In later steps, when you add CO<sub>2</sub>, it represents what would happen if we add more CO<sub>2</sub>.</li></ul>
<b>Your goal</b> for the next step is to play the model. What happens to energy from the Sun? What do you see?<br><br>
Once you understand the picture, click on the next step to start the model.<br>
