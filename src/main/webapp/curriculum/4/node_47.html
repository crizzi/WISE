The biggest contributors to U.S. CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are power plants and automobiles. In this project, you have considered several ways to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions:<br><br>

- Promote adoption of cars powered by ethanol (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O)<br>
- Use hydrogen technology for cars, such as hydrogen combustion or fuel cells<br>
- Promote renewable energy sources such as wind or solar power<br><br>
Two other options are:<br>- Improve gas mileage standards for new cars<br>
- Impose a tax on gasoline </b><br><Br>

You might also be aware of other clean energy technologies. Feel free to consider these options, too. <br><br>

You will now conduct some Internet research to collect additional evidence on <b>what is the best policy to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions</b>.
