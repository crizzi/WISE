you saw in the model, some outward moving IR radiation is absorbed by
carbon dioxide&nbsp;(#1 below) and then re-emitted back down
towards Earth (#2 below). This re-emitted IR warms the Earth. In
reality, many gases do this besides carbon dioxide (such as methane and
water vapor). These gases are called <b>greenhouse gases</b>
because they help keep the Earth warm. If we didn't have greenhouse
gases the Earth's temperature would be very cold. In fact, all of the
Earth's water would freeze solid!<br>
            <br>
But what happens when too much greenhouse effect occurs?
This&nbsp;is called <b>global climate change</b>,
because having too much greenhouse gas in the atmosphere can cause
dramatic changes in climate. In reality, there are many factors that
contribute to changes in the climate. <br>
            <br>
(If you have time at the end of the project, go to the "Extra for
Experts" activity to see how clouds and the albedo also affect sunlight
energy.)<br>
            <br>
            <b>So....what is the difference between the
greenhouse effect and global climate change? </b>Feel free to go
back to the "Add Greenhouse Gases" model to help you figure out the
difference.
