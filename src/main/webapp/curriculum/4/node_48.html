Coal-burning power plants are the largest U.S. source of carbon dioxide pollution -- they produce 2.5 billion tons every year. These power plants give us electricity for our homes. <br><br>

<b>Renewable</b> energy, such as solar and wind power, are <i>renewable</i> because sources like the Sun and wind will not run out. They also do not produce carbon dioxide like coal-burning power plants. We can reduce the amount of carbon dioxide that power plants produce by urging congress to make electricity suppliers increase their use of renewable energy to 20% by 2020. Many states have already adopted this standard.<br><br>
