Hydrogen is a promising fuel for cleaner cars. Hydrogen reacts with oxygen to produce just water and energy:<br>

Two kinds of technology use this reaction. <b>Combustion engines</b> can burn hydrogen much like they burn gasoline. The BMW Hydrogen 7 has two fuel tanks, one for gasoline and one for hydrogen--the same engine burns both fuels! <b> In this investigation we will focus on the COMBUSTION of hydrogen.</B>

<br><b>Fuel cells</b> use hydrogen in a process different from combustion, but the reaction products are the same: water and energy. The Honda FCX Clarity uses fuel cells.
