<b>Renewable</b> energy, such as solar and wind power, are <i>renewable</i> because sources like the sun, wind, and ocean will not run out. They also do not produce carbon dioxide like coal-burning power plants. <b>These technologies transform energy from the sun, wind, or water into usable energy without requiring chemical reactions at all.</b> <br><br>

It could therefore be possible to produce hydrogen using alternative methods such as the hydrolysis of water:<br><br>
<center><b>H<sub>2</sub>O + renewable energy --> H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub></b></center><br><br>


Hydrogen technology could then provide energy without the byproduct of CO<sub>2</sub>, and <b>reducing our dependence on foreign oil.</b> <br><br>
