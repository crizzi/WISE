<font size=+1 face="Arial">As you work through this project, you will explain what you learn like the last step. Good explanations connect ideas, and these ideas can come from inside or outside of chemistry class. Use the following rubric to evaluate your explanations. The same type of rubric will be used by your teachers to assess your work in the project.
